#Hospital System


Welcome to our hospital management system built using Java and Javax! Our system is designed to streamline hospital operations by effectively managing ward assignments and patient information. With a focus on enhancing patient care and organizational efficiency, our platform enables hospitals to easily track ward occupancy, including the number of patients assigned to each bed label.
Moreover, our system facilitates seamless communication and relationship management between doctors, surgeons, and patients. By establishing clear connections between medical professionals and their respective patients, we ensure a transparent and cohesive approach to patient care. This feature enhances situational awareness and aids in identifying and addressing patient needs promptly.
With our comprehensive hospital management system, we aim to optimize hospital workflows, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately enhance the quality of healthcare delivery.
